    <p>This tool is for people who have been offered a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) by an employer to help pay for health insurance for {{benefit_year}}. If you are offered certain types of HRAs, you may not qualify for a tax credit to help purchase a {{marketplace}} plan. This tool will help you determine how the HRA you're offered affects your eligibility for a tax credit and what to do next.</p>
    <p>There are several types of HRAs, and only some of them require you to use this tool. If your HRA requires use of this tool, you should have received a clear written notice from your employer explaining the terms of the HRA. You will need that notice, along with information to help estimate your 2020 household income, when you are ready to use this tool.</p>

    <p>To find out if you’re eligible for a tax credit, you will complete the {{marketplace}} application. But first, here are some important things to keep in mind:</p>
    <p>When completing the application:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Answer “no” when asked if you’re offered health insurance by an employer (unless you are separately offered health insurance by another employer).</li>
    <li>If you are eligible for a tax credit, using it along with your HRA will help make {{marketplace}} coverage more affordable. When you're asked to set your tax credit amount, reduce what you accept by your monthly HRA amount to help avoid having to pay back money at tax time.</li>
    <li>If you are not eligible for a tax credit, you may still purchase a {{marketplace}} plan and use the HRA to help pay for it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using your HRA:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If you enroll in a {{marketplace}} plan or other minimum essential coverage, inform your employer so you can use the HRA.</li>
    <li>If you decide not to enroll in health insurance or you purchase more limited coverage such as a short-term plan, you cannot use the HRA.</li>
    </ul>
  hra_results.determination_results.qsehra_unaffordable.recommendation: |-
    <strong>Based on the information you entered,
    your HRA is not large enough on its own to make health insurance “affordable”
    based on federal standards.</strong> As a result, you may qualify for a tax credit through
    {{marketplace}} based on your income and other factors. If you qualify for a tax
    credit, you can use it in addition to your HRA, but you'll want to adjust the
    amount to avoid owing back money at tax time.
  hra_results.determination_results.qsehra_affordable.next_steps: |-
    <p>Complete the {{marketplace}} application to learn about your options for purchasing health insurance with your HRA. But first, here are some important things to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When completing the application, do not accept a tax credit to purchase health insurance through {{marketplace}}. If you do, you may owe money back at tax time. HOW TO ENROLL THROUGH MARKETPLACE WITHOUT APTC</li>
    <li>If you enroll in a {{marketplace}} plan or other minimum essential coverage, inform your employer so you can use the HRA.</li>
    <li>If you decide not to enroll in health insurance or you purchase more limited coverage such as a short-term plan, you cannot use the HRA.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Based on the information you entered,
    your HRA is large enough to make health insurance “affordable” based on federal
    standards.</strong> As a result, you do not qualify for a tax credit through {{marketplace}}
    for yourself or for any family member who is eligible to benefit from the HRA.
    But, you can use your HRA to help make buying a {{marketplace}} plan more affordable. You can also use your HRA if you enroll in other coverage.
  hra_results.determination_results.ichra_affordable.next_steps: |-
    <p>Purchasing health insurance:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your HRA can help pay for a {{marketplace}} plan or similar coverage off Marketplace. You can also use it if you're enrolled in Medicare. If your employer has offered you a “salary reduction agreement” to pay the share of the health insurance premium not covered by the HRA, you may be better off using your HRA to buy an ACA-compliant plan off Marketplace. Ask your employer about your options.</li>
    <li>If you buy a {{marketplace}} plan, do not accept a tax credit, or you may owe money back at tax time. HOW TO ENROLL THROUGH MARKETPLACE WITHOUT APTC</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Informing your employer:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If you enroll in a {{marketplace}} plan, similar coverage off Marketplace, or Medicare, inform your employer that you are accepting the HRA.</li>
    <li>If you enroll in any other coverage – including more limited coverage such as a short-term plan – or you decide not to purchase health insurance, you cannot use your HRA and must notify your employer that you are opting out.</li>
